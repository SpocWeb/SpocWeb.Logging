# SpocWeb.Logging
This minimal Project provides extension Methods to combine Logging and Formatting.

It can optionally be combined with the SpocWeb.Proxies Project,
which defines a dynamic LoggingProxy Interceptor that can be plugged in via Dependency Injection,
to log all Calls with Parameters and Results.
